## **Background**
This project was born by incorporating my passion for sneakers with learning AI/ML. As a sneakerhead, I have faced many challenges with the unpredictable nature of market prices. As a reseller or buyer, you can lose some serious money with one wrong move or decision. Let’s take this simple dilemma, as an example. Nike is dropping a new dunk, and you are planning to buy 100+ pairs. After purchasing the pairs, you realize that the sneakers are not selling because they are not in high demand as you expected. Your money is now all tied up in inventory that will not sell, which is practically a huge loss.💔

This tool aims to resolve the issue by forecasting which sneaker is most valuable and when to purchase it.
